# Social-Network API

## Description
For this project, I worked on the back end of a social networking site. This site allows you to create a user. With a user profile you can create thoughts and reactions to thoughts of others or even yourself. You can also add and remove other users as friends. I was responsible for writing the back-end API routes for this site. These routes included all CRUD methods for created users and thoughts. I also created the ability to add and remove reactions and friends.

## Installation
To install this program, clone the repository. Once you have the files open in your IDE, open a terminal and run the command `npm i`.
This will install the necessary npm packages, which in this case consits of mongoose and express. If you do you not have Node.js already downloaded, you 
must first download this.
